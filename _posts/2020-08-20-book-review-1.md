The ‘Home and the World’ by Rabindranath Tagore is one of the books that are still relevant today though written in the 1920s. I read the English version, a translation of the original work by Sreegjata Guha. The novel takes us to 1905, in India when the nationalist movement was picking up and revolves around three characters: Nikilesh, a wealthy and broad-minded business or landowner, his timid yet educated wife Bimala and his friend Sandip, a nationalist leader. The story is about the inner journeys of the three characters.  The story is written in the point-of-view of the three characters, enabling us to inhabit their personalities in different chapters in no specific order. Of course, by doing so, we are forced to look at the Nikilesh, Bimala, and Sandip within ourselves.

I found Bimala’s journey the most fascinating. Bimala had her worldview constructed by society: her duties as a woman are confined to the household.  When Nikilesh encourages her to be part of the outside world, she meets Sandip, a nationalist leader. In the story, Bimala confronts the dilemma of choosing between Sandip and Nikilesh. Bimala represents most of us, who as young adults had a concept of the world and our role in it constructed by our circumstances, and yet it was once we were ‘free,’ we had to the opportunity to up our minds and chose the paths we want to take. Bimala’s choices represent the liberal and global identity we carry with us (through Nikilesh) and the labels that are confirmed by borders and nations (through Sandip). Are we Indian first, or are we Hindus first? Are all Hindus the same? Should eating beef be prohibited? What does it mean to be Indian, should we then burn down all British goods? But what if in doing so most innocent Indian’s lives are being affected? The questions that arise in the book are still relevant today in India.


Throughout the story, Sandip’s and Nikilesh’s perception of Bimala is challenged, and to whose vision Bimala’s understanding would lean towards is a subject of the book. When Bimala realizes what she wants, it is truly a moment of liberation that connects with us. The other way of looking at Bimala’s choices is through the nature of the two men: Nikilesh, a patient, decisive and dignified man, and Sandip, a charismatic and ambitious man. Which kind of man would be the most appropriate to achieving freedom for the country, especially when ‘freedom’ means different things to the man.

__“Is there any country, sir,” pursued the history student, “where submission to Government is not due to fear?” “The freedom that exists in any country,” I replied, “may be measured by the extent of this reign of fear. Where its threat is confined to those who would hurt or plunder, there the Government may claim to have freed man from the violence of man. But if fear is to regulate how people are to dress, where they shall trade, or what they must eat, then is man’s freedom of will utterly ignored, and manhood destroyed at the root.”__

I could not help but connect with Nikilesh. His love and his ideologies are put to the test. He seems alone in his path, with the surroundings seeing his liberal views as anti-national or weak and his wife failing to recognize his patience and respect as love. He is well aware that his moral code would lead to tragic consequences for him, and his struggle to come to peace with this constant struggle is captured so well. Sandip, on the other hand, struggles to understand what his love for Bimala means, and how it would affect his ambitions. The way Sandip justifies his violent actions and the deterioration of his friendship with Nikilesh illustrates the blind spots in the nationalist movement.

I highly recommend this book. With its many layers and journeys, I need to read this (at least) once more.
