I recently developed an interest in global health and am finding my way through these resources. I would be regularly updating this space as I go on. 

### Introduction to global health
1. (https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/posts/41300-if-you-had-to-read-one-book-on-global-health)[This] has a list of interesting books on global health to read. 

### Quantitative sciences in medical research
1. (https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1270411142792388608.html)[An excellent thread] from Dr. Maarten on useful resources for stats/ methods in medical research.
2. (https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/reference-collection-to-push-back-against-common-statistical-myths/1787)[Reference collection] to guard against common statistical misconceptions.

### ODEs and dynamics
1. Steven Strogaz's books, I still go back to them when I need a bit of motivation.

### Epidemiology
