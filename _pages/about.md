I am Lekshmi Dharmarajan, a PhD student in the Computational Systems biology group in ETH-Zurich and based in Basel. I recently defended my PhD in May 2020 and am looking for oppurtunities that will prepare me in my long term goal of working in quantitative sciences in the arena of global health and neglected diseases. 

History
======
I was born in beautiful Kerala in India and did my schooling and bachelor degree in engineering in Tamil Nadu. I moved to Switzerland for my Masters looking for an adventure. Here, I encountered computational biology and was instantly hooked to it. I developed an odd obsession with 'time' and 'dynamics' andmy love for longitudinal data analysis began. During the course of my PhD, I have designed and executed computational projects and also ventured into the wet-lab to generate my own microscopy images using budding yeast. I implemented a computational pipeline to infer nonlinear mixed effect models (NLMEs) of signaling networks from time-lapse imaging data. Using the model we inferred with the pipeline, we identified which processes in endocytosis contribute most to the observed heterogeneity in a population of single-cells. My pet project involves modeling the impact of mutations found in cancer on MAPK signaling dynamics. My main expertise lies in longitudinal data analysis, modeling biological data with mechanistic models, nonlinear optimization and uncertainty quantification.  In addition, I have framed exercises and organized tutorials for  a semester course on Experimental Design for master students of Biotechnology at ETH.
